<p align="center"> Tools to convert LSL + friends automatically to BIDS, and upload it to a Dataverse </p>


## 🚀 Getting Started

Get started with LSLAutoBIDS by installing the package and its dependencies.

## 🔰 About the package
This package automates the conversion of xdf files to BIDS format. It also uploads the data to a dataverse. We are using the dataverse at the University of Stuttgart. The package is written in python and uses the pyxdf library to convert the xdf files to BIDS and the pyDataverse library to upload the data to the dataverse.


## Install the package

### Clone the github repository
```
git clone -b working --single-branch https://github.com/s-ccs/LSLAutoBIDS.git

```
## Install dependencies

It is advised to install the requirements in a seperate conda environment.s
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Install the datalad library using the following command:
```
conda install -c conda-forge datalad
```
If you donot have git and git-annex installed in your Operating System, you can give the installation instructions in the [datalad handbook.](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html.)

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in the [data](./data/) directory. The data directory has three subdirectories:

> [!NOTE]  
> This directory root locations can be changed in the [data_config.yaml](data_config.yaml). However, wherever you store the data, the projects and project_stimulus directories expect a structure of organizing each project and subject data in a specific way as described in [data_organization](docs/data_organization.md).

If you use the recommended directory structure, the data directory will look like this and you can follow the following instructions to store the data and if not you can skip this part and directly go to the [configuration](#configuration) section.

```
data
├── bids
├── project_stimulus
├── projects

```
Each directory will have a project name directory inside it and each project directory will have a subdirectory for each subject. The data for each subject will be stored in the subject directory.

1. The raw recorded data needs to be stored in the [`data/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/projects/) directory i.e it will typically contain the xdf files.
2. The experimental files need to be stored in the [`data/project_stimulus/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/project_stimulus/) directory.
This folder contains two subfolders:
    - [`experiment`](./data/project_stimulus/sampleproject/experiment/) folder contains the experimental files.
    - [`sub-<SUBJECT_ID>`](./data/project_stimulus/sampleproject/sub-004/) folder contains the experimental files for each subject.
3. The converted BIDS data needs to be stored in the [`data/bids/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/bids/) directory.

The [`data/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/projects/) directory has one  <PROJECT_NAME> folder for each project. Check [docs/data_organization.md](./docs/data_organization.md) for more details about the naming convention of the data.

Note: The [`data/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/projects/) and [`data/project_stimulus/<PROJECT_NAME>`](./data/project_stimulus/) directories are not created by the package. The user needs to create these directories and store the data in them. 

TODO: For convenience there are some sample data in the [sample_data](./sample_data/) folder.

## Configuration 

This configuration is required to run the scripts. 

1. Project Configuration : This is to be done for each new project.
- Run the command below to create a configuration file template in ./data/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/ folder.

```
python gen_project_config.py -p <PROJECT_NAME>

```
- Edit the configuration file [here](./data/projects/sampleproject/project.toml) to add the project details for the project.

2. Dataverse Credentials Configuration : This is to be done only once, for all the projects if the dataverse is the same.
- Run the command below to create a configuration file template in ./lsl_autobids/ folder.

```
python gen_dv_config.py 

```
- Edit the file [here](dataverse_config.yaml) to add the dataverse details.

3. Dataverse Dataset Configuration : This is to be done for each new project. It stores the data like PID, dataset id for an already created dataset.
- Run the command below to create a configuration file template in ./data/projects/<PROJECT_NAME>/ folder.

```
python gen_dataset_config.py -p <PROJECT_NAME>

```


## Run the scripts

The processing will run in two stages:


**Stage 1 :** 

Preprocessing the new files which needs to be converted into BIDS.
In this stage information about the final files which needs to be processed are stored.

```
python lsl_autobids/main.py -p <PROJECT_NAME> -c data_config.yaml

```
*This part will check for the new files which will be converted to BIDS and uploaded to the dataverse and store it to be processed*

#TODO : Write a xdf file format checker to check if the file is in the correct format.

**Stage 2 :**

 Convert all the processed files into BIDS format and upload it to dataverse by a cron job.

```
python lsl_autobids/convert_to_bids_and_upload.py

```
