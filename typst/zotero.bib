	abstract = {The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}). The portability of these applications ({BIDS} Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. {BIDS} Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the {BIDS} standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. {BIDS} Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use {BIDS} Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.},

So far, {BIDS} was a solution to organise magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) data. The nature and acquisition parameters of {MRI} and {MEG} data are strongly dissimilar. Although there is no standard data format for {MEG}, we propose {MEG}-{BIDS} as a principled solution to store, organise, process and share the multidimensional data volumes produced by the modality. The standard also includes well-defined metadata, to facilitate future data harmonisation and sharing efforts. This responds to unmet needs from the multimodal neuroimaging community and paves the way to further integration of other techniques in electrophysiology. {MEG}-{BIDS} builds on {MRI}-{BIDS}, extending {BIDS} to a multimodal data structure.

Next to rules about organization of the data itself, {BIDS} provides standardized templates to store associated metadata in the form of Javascript Object Notation ({JSON}) and tab separated value ({TSV}) files. It thus facilitates data sharing, eases metadata querying, and enables automatic data analysis pipelines. {BIDS} is a rich system to curate, aggregate, and annotate neuroimaging databases.},

One contributing factor has been the absence of uniform standardization in experiments and data output, an issue that has particularly plagued studies in animal models. Touchscreen-automated cognitive testing of animal models allows standardized outputs that are compatible with open-access sharing. Touchscreen datasets can be combined with different neuro-technologies such as fiber photometry, miniscopes, optogenetics, and {MRI} to evaluate the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Here we describe a platform that allows deposition of these data into an open-access repository. This platform, called {MouseBytes}, is a web-based repository that enables researchers to store, share, visualize, and analyze cognitive data. Here we present the architecture, structure, and the essential infrastructure behind {MouseBytes}. In addition, we describe {MouseBytes}+, a database that allows data from complementary neuro-technologies such as imaging and photometry to be easily integrated with behavioral data in {MouseBytes} to support multi-modal behavioral analysis.},

The archive presently shares more than 600 datasets including data from more than 20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement modalities and a broad range of phenotypes. The impact of the shared data is evident in a growing number of published reuses, currently totalling more than 150 publications.
