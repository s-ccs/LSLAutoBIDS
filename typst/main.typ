Cognitive neuroscience routinely collect large datasets, yet data integration, management, version control, and publishing is rarely automated. Here, we present such a workflow, offering open science by design, with an  implementation in the python based `LSLAutoBIDS` open-source package. We first describe our exemplary workflow based on LabStreamingLayer (to integrate), BIDS (to transform), DataLad (to version), and Dataverse (to publish), before discussing the place such tools can have in future data collection efforts.

= Introduction

Modern neuroscience research often relies on collecting complex, multimodal datasets, combining behavioural data, eye-tracking, and neuroimaging (e.g., EEG) data. Such datasets are valuable for understanding cognitive processes but are often challenging to collect due to the resource-intensive nature of experiments and the logistical demands. They are often collected by trainees or research assistants with limited prior experience or training. To increase the robustness of data analysis pipelines, as well as to encourage data sharing, we present an approach to automate parts of this workflow in terms of four aspects: data integration, data management, data versioning, and data publishing. â€‹Such an automated workflow promotes open science by design @national_academies_of_sciences_engineering_and_medicine_open_2018:

*Data Integration:* Collected data often comes from many sources. LabStreamingLayer (LSL) @kothe_lab_2024 has become a standard way to record multiple data streams and synchronize their time series. In addition, other data sources need to be collected from devices that cannot send them actively (e.g., experimental logging files, eye-tracking data).

*Data Management:* To allow machines and humans to navigate such a diverse data collection, we want to structure them. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) @gorgolewski_brain_2016 standard provides a well-described data management environment, offering consistent directory structure, file naming conventions, and metadata descriptors for neuroimaging data. Once in BIDS, the dataset can be seamlessly integrated into BIDS-compliant analysis pipelines.

*Data Versioning:* The next aspect is to include datasets into version control. While much progress has been made in version control for analysis code, datasets are only rarely versioned by default. DataLad @halchenko_datalad_2021 combines git and git-annex, allowing for efficient versioning of not only code, but also binary files. Crucially, adding new subjects, annotations, or corrections will leave a version trace, greatly improving transparency of the process @hanke_defense_2021.

*Data Publishing:* The last step, which traditionally is often only taken after the data has been fully analyzed, is the long-term publishing. Immediately publishing the raw data has the benefit of frontloading (and externalizing) the additional effort required to publish the data thus it cannot be omitted or forgotten. Automating this is made possible by linking the DataLad @halchenko_datalad_2021 datasets directly with FAIR-enabling @wilkinson_fair_2016 data repositories such as Dataverse @crosas_dataverse_2011, which will provide Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), customizable access controls, archival service, and automatic versioning.

In our work, we addressed all four aspects in a single automated workflow. Our contributions are: (1) we discuss workflow to integrate community standards for data management, automated publishing, and version control, with the potential to generalize across modalities and experimental paradigms, (2) we introduce `LSLAutoBIDS`, a Python package as an example implementation for such a workflow, using Lab Streaming Layer @kothe_lab_2024, converting to BIDS, versioning via Datalad @halchenko_datalad_2021, and publishing via Dataverse.

/*it becomes significantly more difficult to manipulate or selectively alter data post hoc, thereby reducing the risk of scientific misconduct and improving the credibility of the research process (Proof of correctness included here). - just not to forget the point */ 


/*idea : data standardization papers (BIDS and its extension papers) -> Datalad integration in most data management projects - Use of different type of database management (SQLite) - Some papers try to automate source to BIDS (BIDSCoin, mne-bids)- large scale projects reference and our integration to the workflow.*/

The pioneering work of Dobson et al. @dobson_presentations_2018 should be highlighted: They present "ReproIn", a software package quite similar to ours, which converts DICOM data from an MR scanner to BIDS, and finally saves it in a DataLad repository. Compared to our implementation, "ReproIn" is optimized to work with different MR scanners, whereas we use LSL to integrate time-series data more directly. Instead of `heudiconv`, we use `mnelab`, `pylsl`, and `mne-bids` for the data management stage. While "ReproIn" does not automatically link the DataLad repository to a Dataverse, this additional step could be readily implemented to "ReproIn" as well.

Another pioneering approach is taken at the Donders Institute for Brain and Cognition @noauthor_rdm_nodate. There, all fMRI and MEG data are automatically archived in a data acquisition collecting (DAC). Other data needs to be added manually to the DAC. While the DAC is centralized, it is typically only used internally, and later, a data sharing collection (DSC) is created, which can be publicly shared. 


A different example for a data management workflow, incorporating standardization and publishing, i.e, from raw data acquisition over standardization to analysis, is presented in Stawiski et al., @stawiski_optimizing_2024. In this project, they collected heterogeneous raw data of more than 100 participants in two clinics, transformed them to BIDS, and used SQLite to manage the resulting dataset. Even though they do not discuss versioning and publishing, it is easily conceivable how these steps could be added to their workflow.

The previously introduced *Brain Imaging Data Structure* @gorgolewski_brain_2016, originally proposed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a community standard for data management and sharing of brain data within research communities. This standard is designed using the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles @wilkinson_fair_2016, contributing to efficient scientific data management and stewardship. Following the release of the BIDS standard, numerous extensions were developed, concerning integration of BIDS with different neuroimaging techniques like magnetoencephalography (MEG) @niso_meg-bids_2018, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) @holdgraf_ieeg-bids_2019, electroencephalography (EEG) @pernet_eeg-bids_2019, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) @norgaard_pet-bids_2022, and others. Data sharing and reuse of these BIDS-complaint datasets is even further simplified using open-source sharing platforms, for instance, OpenNeuro @markiewicz_openneuro_2021, which currently hosts more than 600 datasets in compliance with BIDS. 

To *convert datasets* to be BIDS compliant, packages like `mne-bids` @appelhoff_mne-bids_2019 or `BIDSCoin` @zwiers_bidscoin_2022 are essential to move and convert source data to BIDS-compliant datasets, and subsequently  the BIDS validator @gorgolewski_brain_2016 can be used to validate the data collection.  Extending these developments, @gorgolewski_bids_2017 proposed a cross-platform, containerized framework for standardized analysis of BIDS datasets across heterogeneous computing environments, including multi-tenant clusters. To make the data conversion even more user-friendly for researchers, BIDSCoin @zwiers_bidscoin_2022 offers a graphical user interface, making it accessible even to those without programming experience.

Unlike software and code versioning, *data versioning* is more rarely practiced, given issues in practicality to version large binary files. Nevertheless, version control is an important aspect in data collection to ensure data traceability and an error-free workflow. DataLad @halchenko_datalad_2021, based on git-annex, nicely extends the capabilities of classical git versioning tools to large, binary datasets. DataLad is actively used in hundreds of studies.



/*
In our workflow, we attempt to incorporate many of the currently available aspects for an efficient data management pipeline, which are currently incorporated in parts by the cited research, and automate the entire process of archiving our recorded heterogeneous data in a standardized BIDS format and depositing it in a Dataverse repository via version control using DataLad. The tool is easily extensible to other input modalities with minimal modifications.

`LSLAutoBIDS` is an open-source Python package developed and actively used by the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at the University of Stuttgart. It offers a modular and reproducible workflow tailored for studies using LSL based data acquisition, specifically targeting the integration of EEG and eye-tracking modalities. 

In this setup, participant-level EEG data streams, but potentially also other LSL streams (eyetracking, motion tracking), are recorded using the LSL protocol, which allows for sub-millisecond time-synchronization of heterogeneously sampled streams. Project metadata like authors, license, experimental description, but also dataverse details are specified in one central configuration-toml file, which is then used to retrieve these project-specific metadata during the conversion process. The recorded raw data streams are then converted into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) @gorgolewski_brain_2016 standard using the `mnelab` @brunner_mnelab_2022, `pylsl`@kothe_chkothepylsl_2025, `mne`@gramfort_meg_2013, and `mne_bids` @appelhoff_mne-bids_2019 packages. Once converted, the BIDS-compliant dataset is automatically deposited into a Dataverse repository, along with the experiment stimulus files and the raw data streams.

In addition to LSL-based EEG data acquisition, `LSLAutoBIDS` supports the incorporation of non-LSL data. For example, in our use case, eye-tracking data are collected using the EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker simultaneously with EEG data collection, which produces proprietary Eyelink data format (EDF) files that cannot easily be streamed via LSL. Other examples are an electronic lab notebook record, log files of the experiment, and a compressed archive of the experimental code used for any each subject individually. `LSLAutoBIDS` accommodates these files as a secondary data modality currently implemented via a netshare drive, and is able to organize them within the appropriate BIDS subdirectories to publish them alongside EEG data.

Version control is integrated into the pipeline using DataLad @halchenko_datalad_2021, enabling precise tracking of all data and metadata changes across the research lifecycle, including modification or re-transformation of the individual files.

After each recording session, the dataset is then uploaded to a Dataverse repository, where it is persistently published with the specified metadata. After data collection is finished, the dataset can be versioned for release and publicly shared with an appropriate data sharing agreement.

The architecture of `LSLAutoBIDS` is deliberately designed to be extensible. Additional files, such as behavioral data, audio recordings, or physiological signals, can be integrated by extending configuration templates and adding corresponding processing steps. This generalizability makes `LSLAutoBIDS` not just a tool for EEG and eye-tracking studies, but a proof of concept for broader multimodal data workflows in cognitive neuroscience.

= Conclusion

Practicing open science by design and frontloading the conversion to a citable data publication efficiently addresses many hurdles researchers face when trying to perform these steps at a later stage. Not only is any analyzed data immediately converted to BIDS, it also is archived, findable, shareable, backed up, and versioned. 

Whether the final dataset is publicly available, or only used internally (e.g. due to privacy-issues in non-defaced MRIs), we think such a workflow will be helpful to many laboratories.
