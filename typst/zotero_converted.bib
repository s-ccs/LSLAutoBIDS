	abstract = {The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world. In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing, versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}). The portability of these applications ({BIDS} Apps) is achieved by using container technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in one convenient package. {BIDS} Apps run on all three major operating systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the {BIDS} standard they require little manual user input. Previous containerized data processing solutions were limited to single user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High Performance Computing systems. {BIDS} Apps overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use {BIDS} Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging algorithms.},

However, even {BIDS} valid metadata can include incorrect values or omissions that result in inconsistent processing across sessions. Additionally, in large-scale, heterogeneous neuroimaging datasets, hidden variability in metadata is difficult to detect and classify. To address these challenges, we created a Python-based software package titled “Curation of {BIDS}” ({CuBIDS}), which provides an intuitive workflow that helps users validate and manage the curation of their neuroimaging datasets. {CuBIDS} includes a robust implementation of {BIDS} validation that scales to large samples and incorporates {DataLad}––a version control software package for data––as an optional dependency to ensure reproducibility and provenance tracking throughout the entire curation process. {CuBIDS} provides tools to help users perform quality control on their images’ metadata and identify unique combinations of imaging parameters. Users can then execute {BIDS} Apps on a subset of participants that represent the full range of acquisition parameters that are present, accelerating pipeline testing on large datasets.},

	abstract = {Neural computations are often fast and anatomically localized. Yet, investigating such computations in humans is challenging because non-invasive methods have either high temporal or spatial resolution, but not both. Of particular relevance, fast neural replay is known to occur throughout the brain in a coordinated fashion about which little is known. We develop a multivariate analysis method for functional magnetic resonance imaging that makes it possible to study sequentially activated neural patterns separated by less than 100 ms with precise spatial resolution. Human participants viewed five images individually and sequentially with speeds up to 32 ms between items. Probabilistic pattern classifiers were trained on activation patterns in visual and ventrotemporal cortex during individual image trials. Applied to sequence trials, probabilistic classifier time courses allow the detection of neural representations and their order. Order detection remains possible at speeds up to 32 ms between items (plus 100 ms per item). The frequency spectrum of the sequentiality metric distinguishes between sub- versus supra-second sequences. Importantly, applied to resting-state data our method reveals fast replay of task-related stimuli in visual cortex. This indicates that non-hippocampal replay occurs even after tasks without memory requirements and shows that our method can be used to detect such spontaneously occurring replay.},

This responds to unmet needs from the multimodal neuroimaging community and paves the way to further integration of other techniques in electrophysiology. {MEG}-{BIDS} builds on {MRI}-{BIDS}, extending {BIDS} to a multimodal data structure.

Touchscreen datasets can be combined with different neuro-technologies such as fiber photometry, miniscopes, optogenetics, and {MRI} to evaluate the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Here we describe a platform that allows deposition of these data into an open-access repository.

We highlight the importance of the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}) standard for enabling effective curation, sharing, and reuse of data. The archive presently shares more than 600 datasets including data from more than 20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement modalities and a broad range of phenotypes.

	abstract = {Neuroscience studies entail the generation of massive collections of heterogeneous data (e.g. demographics, clinical records, medical images). Integration and analysis of such data in research centers is pivotal for elucidating disease mechanisms and improving clinical outcomes. However, data collection in clinics often relies on non-standardized methods, such as paper-based documentation. Moreover, diverse data types are collected in different departments hindering efficient data organization, secure sharing and compliance to the {FAIR} (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Henceforth, in this manuscript we present a specialized data management system designed to enhance research workflows in Deep Brain Stimulation ({DBS}), a state-of-the-art neurosurgical procedure employed to treat symptoms of movement and psychiatric disorders. The system leverages {REDCap} to promote accurate data capture in hospital settings and secure sharing with research institutes, Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}) as image storing standard and a {DBS}-specific {SQLite} database as comprehensive data store and unified interface to all data types. A self-developed Python tool automates the data flow between these three components, ensuring their full interoperability. The proposed framework has already been successfully employed for capturing and analyzing data of 107 patients from 2 medical institutions. It effectively addresses the challenges of managing, sharing and retrieving diverse data types, fostering advancements in data quality, organization, analysis, and collaboration among medical and research institutions.},

	abstract = {10:30 {AM} 10:42 {AM} Lack of reproducibility is a problem in neuroimaging. Adherence to open standards, easy data sharing, and automation of data conversion and analysis steps are some of the key solutions to address it. The formalization of the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}) [1] made it easier for researchers to collaborate on shared data and to benefit from standardized processing using various {BIDS}-aware application. At Dartmouth, following the philosophy that science should be open by design [2], we automated the collection of neuroimaging data as a hierarchy of {BIDS} datasets right from the {MR} scanner. Thus, individual research groups do not have to convert their data to {BIDS} manually, eliminating one of the biggest barriers to data sharing. Adherence to the {BIDS} standard allows investigators to immediately use {BIDS}-aware applications for data {QA} (e.g., bids-validator, {MRIQC} [3]) to catch obvious problems with data acquisition, and to automate preprocessing and analysis. Because the entire process occurs in a Singularity container [4], and all data is version-controlled with {DataLad} and git, our approach eliminates virtually any ambiguity in data provenance. Here we present details of our setup, named {ReproIn} (Reproducible Input). All system configurations, software, and material are released under open-source licenses and are provided in a container, so that any institution can easily implement this solution at their imaging centers.},

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional {MRI} and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that {MRI} is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure ({BIDS}), a standard for organizing and describing {MRI} datasets.

The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the {FAIR} Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the {FAIR} Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
